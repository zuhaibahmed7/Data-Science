           # May - 2190
           # Create a list to store these monthly expenses and using that find out,

#1. In Feb, how many dollars you spent extra compare to January?
#2. Find out your total expense in first quarter (first three months) of the year.
#3. Find out if you spent exactly 2000 dollars in any month
#4. June month just finished and your expense is 1980 dollar. Add this item to our monthly expense list
#5. You returned an item that you bought in a month of April and
#got a refund of 200$. Make a correction to your monthly expense list
#based on this

    #heros=['spider man','thor','hulk','iron man','captain america']
    #1. Length of the list
    #2. Add 'black panther' at the end of this list
    #3. You realize that you need to add 'black panther' after 'hulk', so remove it from the list first and then add it after 'hulk'
    #4. Now you don't like thor and hulk because they get angry easily :)
   #So you want to remove thor and hulk from list and replace them with doctor strange (because he is cool).
   #Do that with one line of code.
    #5. Sort the heros list in alphabetical order (Hint. Use dir() functions to list down all functions available in list)

heros=['spider man','thor','hulk','iron man','captain america']

heros.sort()
