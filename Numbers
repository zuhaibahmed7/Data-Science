#1.You have a football field that is 92 meter long and 48.8 meter wide. Find out total area using python and print it.
#2.You bought 9 packets of potato chips from a store. Each packet costs 1.49 dollar and you gave shopkeeper 20 dollar.
# Find out using python, how many dollars is the shopkeeper going to give you back?
#3.You want to replace tiles in your bathroom which is exactly square and 5.5 feet is its length.
# If tiles cost 500 rs per square feet, how much will be the total cost to replace all tiles.
# Calculate and print the cost using python (Hint: Use power operator ** to find area of a square)
#4.Print binary representation of number 17.
