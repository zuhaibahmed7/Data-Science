#Create two variables to store how many fruits and vegetables you eat in a day.
# Now Print "I eat x veggies and y fruits daily" where x and y presents vegetables and fruits that you eat everyday.
# Use python f string for this.

# This of course is a wrong statement, the correct statement is 'maine 10 samosa khaye'.
# Replace incorrect words in original strong with new ones and print the new string. Also try to do this in one line.
